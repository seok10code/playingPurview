Project Overview
My client needed a way to efficiently maintain metadata, enabling easy data discovery and lineage tracking. Their environment consisted of two source systems:

Databricks Unity Catalog
Meta Miner (with an MSSQL backend)
To integrate these systems, I connected Databricks compute and MSSQL (Meta Minerâ€™s backend). For authentication, I used Azure Key Vault to securely manage credentials.

Handling Meta Miner Metadata
Since Meta Miner does not provide an API for metadata retrieval, I extracted metadata as a CSV file and uploaded it to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 using an API.

To ensure periodic metadata ingestion, I automated this process using Azure Data Factory.
